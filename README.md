# RESTify


This is a project I did during my last year with two of my friends.


Restify is a social media platform for restaurants where users can search, follow, like, and comment on restaurants. 
Moreover, restaurant owners can create blog posts and upload their menus there.



This project was built in three phases.

The first phase consisted on creating static pages. This was done using HTML, CSS and frameworks like bootstrap. 
The second phase consisted on making the API. We used Django for our back-end and SQLite for the databases.
The third phase consisted of putting everything. We used React for front-end and merged our back-end from phases two.

To view all phases of project, please vist `https://github.com/tanejavipul/RESTify-Phases`.
